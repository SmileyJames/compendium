# Compendium

A compendium of games

## Getting Started

First install NodeJS on your system. This will likely include npm.

This repository uses Yarn to manage packages and dependencies of the mono-repo. Yarn can be installed on your machine using npm.

```
npm install --global yarn
```

With Yarn installed you can run yarn to setup the repo.

```
cd compendium # root of git repo
yarn # equivalent to yarn install
```

The app package contains the application, that's where the server can be started.

```
cd app
yarn start # yarn start will start the development server
```

The app README has helpful commands listed also.
